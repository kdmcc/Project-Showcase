This repository holds small parts of some of my previous 
coding projects and assignments to exemplify my coding abilities
and experience.

### Graph.java
#### Summary
Graph.java is an abstract data type that represents a mathematical 
graph made up of nodes and edges. Writing this file was an assignment 
from my Software Design class. However, I went beyond the specifications of the
assignment by implementing additional and more complicated methods to the ADT 
such as getEdgesTo(), removeNode(), removeEdge(), and a few more.
