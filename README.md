# Project Showcase
__This repository holds small parts of some of my previous 
coding projects and assignments to exemplify my coding abilities
and experience.__


## [Graph.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/Graph.java)
### Summary
Graph.java is an abstract data type that represents a mathematical 
graph made up of nodes and edges. Writing this file was an assignment 
from my Software Design class. However, I went beyond the specifications of the
assignment by implementing additional and more complex methods to the ADT 
such as getEdgesTo(), removeNode(), removeEdge(), and a few more.

### Skills Developed
* Writing correct, high quality, and thoroughly documented code.
* Designing and implementing ADTs.
### Experience Gained
* Javadoc.



## [GraphTest.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/GraphTest.java)
### Summary
GraphTest.java contains a suite of jUnit tests for the Graph ADT that I had 
previously implemented. The tests cover all methods for both correct and 
incorrect behavior.

### Skills Developed
* Developing a thorough testing strategy.
* Code Reasoning
### Experience Gained
* jUnit.



## [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/MainActivity.java)
### Summary
MainActivity.java is part of the source code of a simple, single activity Android
app that I made. This project was the final assignment from the same Software Design class
where I implemented Graph.java. This project utilized all of the source code I had written throughout
the class, and gave me experience working with a relatively large library of source code. This project 
introduced me to programming for Android.

### Skills Developed
* Learning a new libray from its documentation.
* Code design and organization.
### Experience Gained
* Programming for Android.
* Working with a large library of source code.



## [CampusPaths.apk](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/CampusPaths.apk)
### Summary
This is the final product that MainActivity.java runs. This was my first experience programming for Android.
The app allows the user select two buildings on the University of Washington campus, and will display the 
shortest path between the two.

I have included instructions on how to run this on a device or emulator below.

### Skills Developed
* Understanding of Android concepts
* Creating functional and robust UI's
### Experience Gained
* Exporting Android product.
* Android Studio


## [SQL_Create_Tables.sqlp](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/SQL_Create_Tables.sqlp)
### Summary
This file is a series of MySQL CREATE TABLE commands to define a database of vehicles, drivers, and insurance companies.
The data is formatted with logical primary and foreign keys. Included in the file is a couple of short questions and answers
about the commands.

### Skills Developed
* Understanding of database concepts and the relational data model.
### Experience Gaines
* MySQL
* SQLite
* Azure
