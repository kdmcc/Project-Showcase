# Project Showcase
__This repository holds small parts of some of my previous 
coding projects and assignments to exemplify my coding abilities
and experience.__


## [Graph.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/Graph.java)
### Summary
Graph.java is an abstract data type that represents a mathematical 
graph made up of nodes and edges. Writing this file was an assignment 
from my Software Design class. However, I went beyond the specifications of the
assignment by implementing additional and more complex methods to the ADT 
such as getEdgesTo(), removeNode(), removeEdge(), and a few more.

### Skills and Abilities
* Writing correct, high quality, and thoroughly documented code.
* Designing and implementing ADTs.
* Experience with Javadoc.



## [GraphTest.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/GraphTest.java)
### Summary
GraphTest.java contains a suite of jUnit tests for the Graph ADT that I had 
previously implemented. The tests cover all methods for both correct and 
incorrect behavior.

### Skills and Abilities
* Developing a thorough testing strategy.
* Experience working with jUnit.



## [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/MainActivity.java)
### Summary
MainActivity.java is part of the source code of a simple, single activity Android
app that I made. This project was the final assignment from the same Software Design class
where I implemented Graph.java. This project utilized all of the source code I had written throughout
the class, and gave me experience working with a relatively large library of source code. This project 
introduced me to programming for Android.

### Skills and Abilities
* Experience programming for Android.
* Learning a new libray from its documentation.
* Experience working with a large library of source code.



## [CampusPaths.apk](https://github.com/kdmcc/Project-Showcase/blob/master/Projects/CampusPaths.apk)
### Summary
This is the final product that MainActivity.java runs. This was my first experience programming for Android.
The app allows the user select two buildings on the University of Washington campus, and will display the 
shortest path between the two.

I have included instructions on how to run this on a device or emulator below.

### Skills and Abilities
* Learned Android concepts
* Creating functional and robust UI's
